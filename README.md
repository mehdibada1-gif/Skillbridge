About this Application

SkillBridge is a digital platform designed to empower young people by bridging the gap between learning and employment. It offers a comprehensive solution for youth aged 16â€“28 who are seeking to develop skills that are directly relevant to the current job market, particularly in the social entrepreneurship and social impact sectors.

The app's main function is to provide a personalized learning experience through a skill assessment engine that recommends customized learning paths. These paths lead to tangible outcomes, such as a professional portfolio and micro-certifications that are verifiable through blockchain technology. This not only validates a user's skills but also makes them more competitive in the job market.

By combining learning, skill validation, and job matching in one integrated platform, SkillBridge goes beyond traditional online courses. It provides a clear pathway from education to employment and social impact, helping to reduce youth unemployment and foster a new generation of skilled and innovative social entrepreneurs.
